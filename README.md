# PortPilot

PortPilotis a Python command-line tool that allows users to scan a target machine for open ports. Built using socket programming, this tool supports both TCP and UDP scans and provides verbose output to make it easy for users to interpret the scan results.

With PortPilot, users can specify a range of ports to scan, allowing for quick and efficient port scanning. Multi-threading is also implemented to improve scan speed, with the tool able to scan multiple ports at the same time.

PortPilot is an ideal tool for system administrators, network engineers, or cybersecurity professionals who need to identify open ports on a target machine. With its simple yet powerful interface, PyPortScan provides users with a comprehensive understanding of the security posture of their network and enables them to take appropriate action to secure their systems.
